# technojam-task--DSA-CP-

Hi! My name is Talal Zaffar and I'm a first year student in GU.


#easy_task_1 

The logic I used here was to use the xor operator on the first element of the array with the elements in the encoded array, to get the original array back. 

#easy_task_2

The logic I used here was to first sort the elements in both the lists. Then find the absolute difference of the elements in both the lists and sum that to the total required at the end.  

#easy_task_3

Not too sure what to write here, I initialized a for loop for the values in'k' and used an if else block according to what was asked in the question, i guess.

#easy_task_4

Again, initialized a for loop for the elements of the entered word and used an if else block
